# Readme-pls

## Description

This personalized Readme Generator was in made in the hopes that any amateur coder could use it as a jump start of making a quality Readme for any of their projects. As a developer just starting out, I understand that when you're nearing the end of a project, the last thing to worry about is the readme, and by that point the developer is exhausted and will likely falter when it comes to fleshing out all the detail that goes into a quality README. This personalized Readme Generator was not made without its trials and tribulations, one of them being how difficult the starter code was to work around. After a few errors, I found it simpler to start over and only use what I needed from the starter code, such as the init functions, as well as the generate markdown functions. The hardest part of this endeavor was definitely figuring out how to call each unique license badge to its respective title, as well as the spacing within the Readme itself. I hope that any developer can use this generator to make a truly professional readme!

## Usage

![Screenshot of readme generator prompt questions and generated Readme file](<assets/images/Screenshot (63).png>)

To use the personalised README generator, simply open the index.js in the intergrated terminal, run node index.js, and the user should be prompted with a series of questions on what they would like in their README and what each portion of the README should say. When the user is finished, the personalised to them README should be automatically generated, and be able to preview immediately, as shown in the attached screenshot.
